      <description>Arch Linux&amp;rsquo;s official website describes Arch as a distribution that &amp;ldquo;tries to Keep It Simple&amp;rdquo;. It also states that Arch is not for those without the ability or time for a &amp;ldquo;do-it-yourself&amp;rdquo; system&amp;ndash;which is true. I recently built a machine that needed a lightweight OS, so Arch Linux was a good choice. Installing Arch Linux can seem complicated, but understanding what needs to happen in each step of the install makes it feel fun and easy.</description>
