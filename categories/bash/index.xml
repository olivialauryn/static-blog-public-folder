      <description>Bash, or the Bourne-Again SHell, is named after the creator of the Unix shell Stephen Bourn. Bash is a command language interpreter that can execute commands and process text files as input. Shell scripts are, basically, files containing a series of commands. You can schedule Bash scripts to run at certain times to automate tasks for you.
If you are using a Linux machine, you can write and execute Bash scripts in terminal.</description>

      <description>The final step in building my bird cam was creating a way to view the bird photos on demand. To do this I utilized Docker on a third Raspberry Pi by installing Docker and Docker Compose.
sudo apt install docker sudo apt install docker-compose  Compose is a useful Docker tool that, among other things, allows you to run multi-container applications configured in a YAML file. On Docker Hub a useful photo gallery image linuxserver/photoshow has already been created, so I used that image to serve up the bird photos.</description>

      <description>After setting up the NFS server, but before making any NFS clients, I configured another Raspberry Pi to take the photos for my Bird Cam project. For this I used a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the appropriate camera attachment. Instead of using a keyboard/monitor to configure the Zero, I created a headless setup to allow the Zero to connect to wifi automatically when plugged in.
First, I put the Raspbian Lite OS on a mini SD card.</description>

      <description>In this project I wanted to set up a camera to take pictures of pretty birds at a feeder, and then view those photos online. To do so I used three Raspberry Pis, NFS, and Docker.
One Raspberry pi served as the NFS server, while the other two were NFS clients. One of the clients was a Raspberry Pi zero w outfitted with a camera to take the pictures and store them on the NFS server.</description>
