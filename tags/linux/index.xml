      <description>Bash, or the Bourne-Again SHell, is named after the creator of the Unix shell Stephen Bourn. Bash is a command language interpreter that can execute commands and process text files as input. Shell scripts are, basically, files containing a series of commands. You can schedule Bash scripts to run at certain times to automate tasks for you.
If you are using a Linux machine, you can write and execute Bash scripts in terminal.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Terraform Terraform by Hashicorp is a &amp;ldquo;tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently&amp;rdquo;. Terraform works using infrastructure as code, meaning that build a blueprint of the resources you need in a configuration file (with the .tf extension) and Terraform builds that infrastructure for you. The Terraform package itself is a single binary file, easily downloaded, and is used to build/edit/destroy your resources.
In contrast to older versions of infrastructure build tools like Packer, Terraform allows you to create infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and is &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; enough to know how many more machines to create in context of what you already have.</description>

      <description>Arch Linux&amp;rsquo;s official website describes Arch as a distribution that &amp;ldquo;tries to Keep It Simple&amp;rdquo;. It also states that Arch is not for those without the ability or time for a &amp;ldquo;do-it-yourself&amp;rdquo; system&amp;ndash;which is true. I recently built a machine that needed a lightweight OS, so Arch Linux was a good choice. Installing Arch Linux can seem complicated, but understanding what needs to happen in each step of the install makes it feel fun and easy.</description>
