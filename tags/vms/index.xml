      <description>Introduction to Terraform Terraform by Hashicorp is a &amp;ldquo;tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently&amp;rdquo;. Terraform works using infrastructure as code, meaning that build a blueprint of the resources you need in a configuration file (with the .tf extension) and Terraform builds that infrastructure for you. The Terraform package itself is a single binary file, easily downloaded, and is used to build/edit/destroy your resources.
In contrast to older versions of infrastructure build tools like Packer, Terraform allows you to create infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and is &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; enough to know how many more machines to create in context of what you already have.</description>

      <description>Practicing installing/updating/building machines is much more fun when you aren&amp;rsquo;t running the risk of ruining an entire computer. To give myself a safe environment to work in, I have been using VMware&amp;rsquo;s vSphere in our home lab for many of my computer projects. vSphere is a suite of virtualization products that allow you to create and manage VMs. This allows me to work on VMs that can run any OS I like, and if I something goes wrong I can just delete the VM and begin again.</description>
